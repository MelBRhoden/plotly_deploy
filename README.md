Improbable Beef is attempting to manufacture bacteria that will serve as a synthetic beef replacement. If Improbable Beef identifies an appropriate bacterial species, we want to be ready with Roza's volunteer's data to identify whether the identified species is found in one or more of her volunteer's belly button.

To help visualize Roza's data I have created an HTML/JavaScript page that displays a customized dashboard with a bar chart, a bubble chart and gauge designed to identify different types of bacteria. The user chooses the volunteer's ID number from the drop down list on the left and all of the volunteer's data is displayed on the page automatically. The dashboard is filtered by static data. The bubble chart provides a visualization identifying the top 10 bacterial species in the volunteers' belly buttons. The gauge identifies the number of times a volunteer washed thier belly button while they were a volunteer.
